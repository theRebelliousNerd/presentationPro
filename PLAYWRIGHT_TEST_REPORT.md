- **Token Usage:** Increased from 3427/1646 to 3492/1715

#### Second AI Interaction  
- **AI Question:** Asked about target audience (medical professionals, technical experts, etc.)
- **User Response:** Specified technical experts and medical professionals - radiologists, AI researchers, hospital CTO/IT directors
- **Context Meter:** Increased to 55%
- **Token Usage:** Updated to 3550/1786

#### Third AI Interaction
- **AI Question:** Asked about presentation length and format (30-minute conference talk, 1-hour workshop, etc.)
- **Context Meter:** Reached 85%
- **Result:** Excellent context understanding achieved

### 4. State Transition Testing
**Test:** Application workflow state changes  
**Result:** ‚úÖ PASS  
**Details:**
- ‚úÖ Successfully transitioned from `initial` to `clarifying` state
- ‚úÖ UI properly adapted to show clarification-focused interface
- ‚úÖ Form parameters preserved during state transition
- ‚úÖ Chat history maintained across interactions
- ‚úÖ Context meter accurately reflects understanding level

### 5. Real-time Token Tracking
**Test:** Monitor API usage and token consumption  
**Result:** ‚úÖ PASS  
**Details:**
- ‚úÖ Token counter updates in real-time with each AI interaction
- ‚úÖ Shows both input and output tokens separately
- ‚úÖ Total progression: 3427/1646 ‚Üí 3492/1715 ‚Üí 3550/1786
- ‚úÖ Cost estimation displays (currently $0.0000 - needs pricing configuration)

### 6. Data Persistence Issues
**Test:** Presentation data saving to backend  
**Result:** ‚ùå FAIL (Expected)  
**Details:**
- ‚ùå Multiple Firestore errors in console:
  ```
  Failed to save presentation to Firestore: FirebaseError: Function setDoc() called with invalid data
  WebChannelConnection transport errored
  ```
- **Root Cause:** Firestore configuration issues / invalid data format
- **Impact:** No immediate user impact - localStorage fallback working
- **Status:** ArangoDB migration already in progress to resolve this

## Key Findings

### üéØ Strengths
1. **Excellent AI Integration:** The ADK/A2A backend is working perfectly with intelligent conversation flow
2. **Smooth User Experience:** Form handling, state transitions, and UI responsiveness all excellent  
3. **Real-time Feedback:** Context meter and token tracking provide valuable user feedback
4. **Robust Frontend:** React components handle state changes gracefully
5. **Proper Error Handling:** Firestore failures don't crash the application

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified
1. **Data Persistence:** Firestore errors prevent presentation saving
2. **Missing Features:** Unable to test full slide generation due to early-stage testing
3. **Cost Display:** Pricing configuration needed for accurate cost estimation

### üîß Technical Observations
1. **API Connectivity:** ADK backend at localhost:8089 responding correctly
2. **Token Management:** Proper API key usage and response handling
3. **State Management:** React hooks and localStorage working as designed
4. **Performance:** Fast response times for AI interactions
5. **Browser Compatibility:** Testing in Chromium - full compatibility

## Playwright Test Automation Success
