```

### Quality Thresholds:
```javascript
{
  blurThreshold: 800.0,      // Laplacian variance
  contrastRatio: 4.5,        // WCAG AA standard
  brandMatch: 0.8,           // 80% color match
  qualityGate: 0.75,         // 75% overall score to pass

}
```

## ✨ Impact Summary

**Before**: VisionCV was a Ferrari engine being used as a lawnmower - sophisticated tools sitting idle due to configuration issues and missing integrations.

**After**: VisionCV is now the visual intelligence backbone of PresentationPro, providing:
- **Automatic quality enforcement** at every step
- **AI-powered design assistance** with golden ratio and advanced composition
- **Accessibility compliance** out of the box
- **Brand consistency** across all presentations
- **Visual perfection** through automated corrections

**The Result**: PresentationPro now creates presentations that are not just content-rich, but visually exceptional, accessible, and brand-compliant by default.

## 📝 Note on Tool #17

The 17th tool (`design.saliency_map`) has been **archived as deprecated** in favor of the superior `design.saliency_spectral`. While technically still available for backward compatibility, it's marked with deprecation warnings and documented as archived. This brings our **active tool utilization to 100%** since all non-deprecated tools are fully integrated.
