# ⚠️ WARNING: EXAMPLE CODE ONLY - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION ⚠️

## 🚫 THIS IS REFERENCE CODE ONLY 🚫

### CRITICAL: READ THIS FIRST

This directory contains **EXAMPLE CODE FROM INSTAVIBE** that is:

- ✅ **FOR REFERENCE ONLY** - Study the patterns and approaches
- ✅ **FOR LEARNING** - Understand ADK/A2A implementation patterns
- ❌ **NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE** - Never copy directly into the app
- ❌ **NOT PART OF THE APPLICATION** - This is external example code
- ❌ **NOT TO BE IMPORTED** - Do not import or require these files

### What This Directory Contains

Example implementation of InstaVibe - a social event planning application that demonstrates:
- Multi-agent orchestration patterns
- A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol implementation
- ADK (Agent Development Kit) usage patterns
- Flask web application structure

### How to Use This Reference

1. **Study the patterns** - Look at how agents communicate
2. **Learn the structure** - Understand the organization
3. **Adapt concepts** - Take ideas and reimplement them properly
4. **Never copy directly** - Always write fresh code for the actual application

### Remember

🔴 **These files are examples from a completely different application**
🔴 **They should NEVER be executed or imported in PresentationPro**
🔴 **They are here ONLY to provide implementation reference**

**If you're working on PresentationPro, the actual code is in:**
- `/adkpy/` - The real ADK backend
- `/src/` - The real Next.js frontend
- **NOT HERE** - This is just reference material
