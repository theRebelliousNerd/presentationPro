### **Next-Gen App Style Guide**

This guide outlines the visual and interactive standards for all applications built for Next-Gen Engineering and Research Development. Our brand is innovative, precise, and trustworthy. Our app design should reflect these core principles through clarity, consistency, and a forward-thinking aesthetic.

#### **1. Core Principles**

* **Clarity:** Interfaces should be intuitive and easy to navigate. Information should be presented clearly and concisely.
* **Precision:** Every element, from spacing to typography, should feel deliberate and well-aligned. Attention to detail is key.
* **Innovation:** The look and feel should be modern and clean, reflecting our position at the forefront of technology.
* **Reliability:** The design should inspire confidence and trust. It should be robust, accessible, and performant.

#### **2. Logo Usage**

The Next-Gen logo is our primary brand identifier.

* **Primary Logo:** The full-color version with the dark navy, green, and tagline should be used whenever possible on light backgrounds.
* **Clear Space:** Always maintain a clear space around the logo equal to the height of the "N" in "NEXT-GEN." Do not crowd the logo with other elements.
* **Don'ts:**
    * Do not stretch, distort, or alter the logo's proportions.
    * Do not change the logo's colors.
    * Do not place the full-color logo on a background that compromises its legibility. For dark backgrounds, a reversed (all-white/light gray) version should be created and used.

#### **3. Color Palette**

Our color palette is built on a foundation of deep, professional navy, accented by a vibrant, forward-looking green.

##### **Primary Colors**

* **Deep Navy (`#192940`):** The primary color for text, dark backgrounds, navigation bars, and major structural elements. It conveys professionalism and stability.
* **Action Green (`#73BF50`):** The primary accent color. Use this for key calls-to-action (CTAs) like primary buttons, active state indicators, and important highlights. Use it thoughtfully to draw the user's attention.

##### **Secondary Colors**

* **Slate Blue (`#556273`):** A supportive, neutral color. Ideal for secondary buttons, inactive icons, supplemental text, and card borders.
* **Muted Green (`#83A64E`):** A less vibrant green for secondary information, success states, or decorative elements where the Action Green would be too overpowering.

##### **Neutral & System Colors**

* **Light Gray (`#F2F2F2`):** The primary background color for most screens. It's easier on the eyes than pure white.
* **Pure Black (`#0D0D0D`):** To be used sparingly, primarily for body text on light backgrounds where maximum contrast is required.
* **Success (`#83A64E`):** For success messages, confirmation notifications, and validation.
* **Warning (`#F5A623`):** For non-critical alerts or warnings that require user attention. (Note: This color is a standard suggestion that complements the palette).
* **Error (`#D0021B`):** For error messages, failed validation, and critical alerts. (Note: This color is a standard suggestion that complements the palette).

#### **4. Typography**

Our typography is clean, modern, and highly legible, reflecting a tech-focused brand. We recommend using a versatile sans-serif font family like **Montserrat** for headings and **Roboto** for body text.

* **Headings (Montserrat)**
    * **H1 / Page Title:** 32px, Bold
    * **H2 / Section Title:** 24px, Bold
    * **H3 / Card Title:** 20px, Semi-Bold
* **Body Text (Roboto)**
    * **Body / Paragraph:** 16px, Regular. Use Pure Black (`#0D0D0D`) or Deep Navy (`#192940`) for text on light backgrounds.
    * **Label / Small Text:** 14px, Regular. Often used for form labels or metadata.
    * **Caption / Helper Text:** 12px, Regular. Use Slate Blue (`#556273`) for less important text.

#### **5. UI Components**

Consistency in interactive elements is crucial for a good user experience.

##### **Buttons**

* **Primary Button:** Solid **Action Green** (`#73BF50`) background with white text. Used for the main action on a page.
* **Secondary Button:** White or Light Gray background with a **Slate Blue** (`#556273`) border and text. Used for secondary actions.
* **Tertiary/Text Button:** No background or border. Use **Action Green** text to indicate it's a clickable link or minor action.
* **Disabled State:** All buttons should have a disabled state with 40% opacity and a "not-allowed" cursor on hover.

##### **Forms & Inputs**

* **Fields:** Use a subtle gray border. When a field is in focus, the border should change to **Slate Blue** (`#556273`).
* **Labels:** Should appear above their corresponding input field.
* **Checkboxes & Radio Buttons:** When selected, the fill color should be **Action Green**.

##### **Cards & Containers**

* Cards should be used to group related information.
* Use a white or **Light Gray** (`#F2F2F2`) background.
* Define cards with a subtle drop shadow or a 1px solid border in a very light gray.
* Use a consistent corner radius, such as 4px or 8px, to maintain a clean, modern look.

#### **6. Iconography**

Icons should be simple, clear, and consistent in style.

* **Style:** Use a clean, line-art style (e.g., Material Symbols - Outlined). Avoid overly detailed or illustrative icons for UI purposes.
* **Color:** Inactive icons should use **Slate Blue** (`#556273`). Active or focused icons should use **Action Green** (`#73BF50`).

#### **7. Spacing & Layout**

Follow a consistent spacing system to create a harmonious and uncluttered layout.

* **Base Unit:** Use an 8px grid. All margins, padding, and layout dimensions should be multiples of 8 (e.g., 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px). This ensures visual consistency across all screens.

#### **8. Voice & Tone**

The language used within the app should be:

* **Professional & Clear:** Avoid jargon where possible. Be direct and to the point.
* **Concise:** Use simple sentence structures.
* **Empowering:** Frame instructions and feedback in a helpful and positive way. For example, instead of "Invalid input," use "Please enter a valid email address."
