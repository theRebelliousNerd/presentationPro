# **Transcript**

Steven Moore: Okay, very cool. I don't Jason.

Robert Probst: Jason.

Jason Aaron: Can you hear me? all right,…

Steven Moore: Yeah.

Jason Aaron: Steven I guess…

Robert Probst: Yes.

Steven Moore: Those are.

Jason Aaron: if you can kind of share with Robert, some of the things that you told me yesterday, and kind of explain what you're interested in the centric system, Then we can go from.

Steven Moore: So, yeah, I'll go through the whole kingdom and be, but before I do that, I guess, if I have my name's Steve, I am one of the partners here at next Gen. Engineering Research Department. We are a brand spanking, new engineering slash manufacturers rep firm spun out of it. Another distributor who actually used to sell you quite a bit of parts. company called Nac Semi out of Florida. And if you're familiar or probably not since you're in product management, not in the procurement side of things. but,

Steven Moore: Yeah, we specialize in communications. And industrial or your operations technology, energy storage, renewables, and things that nature. But even more than that, we solve really complex problems for very big companies folks like Exxon Mobile Mitsubishi, etc, etc. We partner with these folks. That is a pretty neato bonito things. Tell me, A little bit about Robert's and Jason a little bit more detailed. So I can know who I'm talking to and then we'll get started.

Robert Probst: You go, first Jason.

Jason Aaron: Okay, so Steven I've been with Megger for about five years. I'm a project manager and lead of technical support out of Dallas and support our customers on their cable needs. I worked directly with Robert to help support our customers and Trying to help meet their. Testing and diagnostics and cable file locating meet.

Steven Moore: And not just for me it's for the guys will be showing this to afterwards, so

Robert Probst: I have some audio problem.

Jason Aaron: I got it.

Jason Aaron: Robert.

Steven Moore: And Robert.

Robert Probst: Here, can you hear me? Okay, good. my name is Robert.

Steven Moore: 

Robert Probst: I am the product manager for all cable fault location that is manufactured in Germany.

Steven Moore: Yes.

Jason Aaron: Yes.

Robert Probst: So, all of the equipment, And I am responsible from portables over test vans to special offshore solutions and even projects like interconnectors between countries. When we supply systems for those and I am stationed in Germany. I live in Germany. I used to be in the US for a while. And I'm also aligning the strategy with our third factory in Valley Forge. They also have some cable products and I keep everybody kind of on track that we have a nice portfolio and don't do stupid in-house competition things.

Steven Moore: I love it, that's great. All cool. So that being said, let me get into what I'm up to so, I'm going to bring up probably. So here's what's going on. There's a little company by the name of Exxon Mobil that you may or may have heard of that. I've been working with over the last five years or so and different capacities regulation with those fellows over there and We are addressing a problem that they've been struggling with the last hour, 20 years or so. Basically, what does have happening? Is that when hurricanes come through and actually I'll share my screen so we can get a good idea what's going on here?

Steven Moore: So the folks that I'm currently talking with are formerly denberry resources,…

Robert Probst: Okay.

Steven Moore: they were required by ExxonMobil about a year ago. And edge about 1.93 million. Acres of oil fields and pipelines across the United States.

Steven Moore: When hurricane comes through because barreling on through this nice fine town. A couple things happen. First thing is, you get antennas blow over comm systems, go out because of power surges, your traditional power systems, go out quite a few different problems arise, which is fine. If the second problem that happens after the fact didn't happen, which is when the power is out, you can see that the amount of land that, these oil fields are taking up is pretty. Gosh darn. So expansive there are all over the gosh, darn place kind of scars the earth so because of that, you can't really secure these fields very well. You can't really put up fences one field up. And Montana is 83,000, continuous acres. Very hard to put up a fence that really works particularly well.

### 00:05:00

Steven Moore: And there's not really too many good ways of putting up camera systems that would, be able to prevent any kind of, issue. So what happens is folks will they come drive on this and their pickup trucks, my goal of trail over there, calls them copper miners and they will drive on somewhere on this big old field. And it will say they might be here or something. And they'll dig a hole and they'll pull out Some of them, the feeder cables like 500 mcm, they'll grab them their trucks and rip them out of the ground pickup trucks, because the fields are so vast. When the power comes back kicks, it gets kicked back on. The Exxon folks come driving out and they have to go and manually to each different pump station. Go one by one by one, do all manual checks for communications.

Steven Moore: Power system failures. And then sometimes, they don't know if it's a power system failure, because there's a power surge Or something like that or if it was someone ripping cable out of the ground somewhere. Someone stole a transformers, aren't aware of. Which becomes very problematic. So it takes them months to get through a situation such this. Cool.

Steven Moore: Any questions about this part?

Jason Aaron: I don't have any.

Steven Moore: And That's a problem. Steven's all good.

Robert Probst: Yeah, my connection is really bad. I don't know what's going on. It suddenly went bad. One moment.

Steven Moore: You wanna try popping out of the meeting? I'll come back in maybe.

Robert Probst: I will try to switch to my hotspot.

Steven Moore: Not sure I wait for Robert, he's the bell to ball this situation.

Steven Moore: Let me know when to continue.

Steven Moore: You're good.

Robert Probst: I'm back. And The audio is much better now.

Steven Moore: Awesome. Did you catch the problem?

Robert Probst: Alright. Yeah,…

Steven Moore: Walk through.

### 00:10:00

Robert Probst: I lost you kind of when you said they're pulling out cable and now they have to go to all of these individual pump station to do something.

Steven Moore: Yep, So because they have to test for communications and power to see what's out and why they'll drive out to, pump 4,076 here, whatever it is. And They will have no ability to tell,…

Robert Probst: Yes.

Steven Moore: if the power's out because of a surge, you may have fried, some of the stuff that was, in their pump, stations or skate, a boxes, or if somebody upstream somewhere in this network of fun, hold cable out of the ground, or still a transformer or some kind of other thing that world, right? So there's a lot of leg work that has to happen for them to test. All these different systems and subsystems both on the communication side and electrical side. so, there's still trying To try to get back up and running for full tilt because of hurricane barrel. And this is, months ago, So, this happens every time there's a hurricane. All hands on deck takes forever, to get out to get everything back up and running and it's not very good. that's basically the problem that we're trying to solve is how do we get back up and running faster?

Steven Moore: So here is the general solution that we came up with. To go and accomplish that. So Have you ever heard of Class 4 power? Robert?

Robert Probst: Last four power. No.

Steven Moore: So it's a new class of power came out in the 2023 nec. And Class four powers. What's So Volt server was actually the inventor of this Power distribution system.

Steven Moore: What it is, how it came about is actually in the B2 bomber program, there's a piece of the plane that couldn't be covered. It was running high voltage DC on it. And for whatever reason they couldn't make it safe for people to walk around. So I had to find a way to

Steven Moore: If somebody bumped into it, they wouldn't fry a pancake. So these solutions come up with was called now digital electricity. So what they're doing is running 380 volts, DC Over a very tiny conductor. And they run it at 500\. 500 hertz. They pulsi electricity and between each pulse, there's a safety validation check So, instead of it being your standard power system, it goes to a transmitter which, breaks up in the pulses, puts the safety validation, data in there and sends it down a conductor, which hits a receiver, the receiver, then Demodulates, the DC and you can output into ac/dc, whatever you want. It's completely up to, whatever you need at the edge. and then it returns the safety validation data on the back side, so,

Steven Moore: What you have is inherently safe. System for delivering high power over tiny, little cables up to two kilometers away, because once you hit around two kilometers, the magnetic induction, the wires will destroy the safety data packet. So you then no longer have the ability to do any of your fall detection. It's pretty Nifty.

Steven Moore: The reason why I bring this up is because this is actually the missing piece of the puzzle to do batch testing. So what I came up with is a mobile battery, energy storage system on a trailer. I can have a picture of it early design. I'll do that. No problem. It's getting a few seconds out mobiles and There we go, there.

Steven Moore: So this happened months ago or certain design process. So what you have is a mobile battery storage system and a generator so that are gonna be on it. And then in addition to that there's gonna be a server rack that's gonna be on the mobile best unit. In the server rack, you're gonna have a Power distribution system, So just, sits into a regular old server rack and then you're running a fiber, optic, hybrid cable out from the core to the edge and two kilometers in every direction and then We'll have industrial compute. We'll have a guard all of your all of your testing apparati, any of that kind of stuff. And then at the very top of this mask, you're gonna have a high throughput data backhaul.

Steven Moore: So in a couple other cool little functions there's gonna be a private wireless, system on there. So you have a tablet. You can walk around with all of your, remote controls for running in your test that you need. And so because of that, we have to do is find or find a partner to do the electrical testing. We already have, software for network testing. All that kind of stuff figured out but the one place that we have one thing you don't have is the ability to do testing of the electrical systems in a wide dispersed area. So basically to give an idea what I'm about. So we want to do this section What we would do and measure distance, From this point here, we say park the trailer. Link link. That's a 2000 foot run there.

### 00:15:00

Steven Moore: and then, A resistance, we can connect everything every single thing in this pathway, with a star. formulation for, connecting everything to the core that's like 3,000 feet so you can basically get

Steven Moore: Clear measurement. You can get pretty much every pump Jack. In this entire section.

Steven Moore: Connected from one trailer may position So you'll be able to do batch testing of the systems. And on top of that, you'll be able to temporarily back up and power those systems while you're doing it. At the same time. If that makes sense. Because the whole server can run again,…

Robert Probst: Okay.

Steven Moore: 3,000 watts to the edge. Without any kind of, protection of an opera conduit, you have to worry about any of the codes. Basically, a extension cable on steroids using very tiny conductors. the other using 16 gauge twisted pair to run three kilowatts.

Robert Probst: Okay.

Steven Moore: So, what I am looking to do is to figure out if you find folks. could take work as a partner with Mitsubishi and myself and also the other folks that I brought to bid this is all my design. To do all of your fault to testing logistics, all kind of stuff. I see that All of your testing stuff is all. Condensed into, one mobile command center right here. And basically, I'm just looking to integrate all the smarts. instead of being on a drivable thing, integrated onto these trailers, and then whatever's going on at the edge, if it's,

Steven Moore: Whatever you suggest it really more. You guys are much better. What they probably need knowing what they need then I will. But we'll be working with ExxonMobil directly, to spec in whatever you think is the best set of solutions that would go into this trailer in the central location and then we take it to mass production

Robert Probst: Okay, so lots of information. So there's a few key problems or key questions here. so the thing is,…

Steven Moore: of course.

Robert Probst: Fault location like on power cables.

Robert Probst: A relies on the fact that there is some sort of physics that you can exploit and that each method that you have is based on. So for instance, typically on regular power cables, we make the distinction between high resistance faults and then you have some other, sheath faults intermittent faults whatever. And there's let's say a variety of methods which is very suited to address one of these fall. So there's no method that can address all of them. So, you need multiple methods. So, that is,…

Steven Moore: Yep.

Robert Probst: that is the first pick up here, so to speak that. It depends really on the nature of the fault,

Robert Probst: Or that determines what you can use or What's the best method to use? So the next thing is connections so when you,…

Steven Moore: Yep.

Robert Probst: when you had this map up then you pick this random intersection and…

Steven Moore: Yeah.

Robert Probst: you said, Hey, I can connect there. so, when you say connect how exactly would that look what would that?

Steven Moore: all right, so Not a problem and…

Robert Probst: What would that look like?

Steven Moore: it's really just parking the trailer so we can park the trailer wherever that we want. So it could be next to a panel.

Robert Probst: Okay.

Steven Moore: It could be next to a switchboard We get next to a transformer. Next to a middle of a field, doesn't really matter where it's completely mobile. And then from this point, we just decide just for funsies that this is where we're gonna be putting the trailer for the time So I want to do testing for this section of the field. All right. How do I delete that and So, they want to pick right there. So the distances are just, how far the volt server cables can run. Before it hits the end of the line. And at the end of that cable is whatever the heck you want to put, if you have, let's say you wanted to stick the side wave this vlf or whatever. you wanted to put that on the edge? I think that's what has batteries on the bottom of it. Right? Is a batteries in this thing?

### 00:20:00

Robert Probst: No no no. It does not.

Steven Moore: Or one of these things, my batteries Something that's batteries, I'm assuming, but if you need a batteries on it, you wouldn't need to have batteries. It'll just be literally connected directly with a hard line, back to the best. And I get two kilometer radius.

Robert Probst: Yeah.

Steven Moore: Or additionally, if it could work, if it has to go further away than that. And there's some kind of says, I mean, I don't know how the testing works to be totally honest with you. You can imagine you're talking to a electrical testing, idiot. But you're talking through me on the recording to a bunch of really smart engineer-type, folks that are just incredibly busy because you will be talking to them soon if there's a

Steven Moore: A good fit, which I think there probably is. so, Whatever methodology that you want to use for testing of this of the,…

Robert Probst: Yeah.

Steven Moore: If it's a high voltage cable, it's a medium voltage cable. If it's a ground fault detection, or whatever, and whatever it is, you want to do the endpoints and the best trailer itself. the server rack could have numerous Different functionalities that are completely modular. it just slide in, whatever it is into the core for any kind of compute or whatever you put in a core in your centrix fan and that the edge you can replace The edge with whatever you want. That's the,…

Robert Probst: So okay,…

Steven Moore: that's the thing.

Robert Probst: the norm or let's say the way it is, it is done in any kind of let's say, power cable environment. Is that? You are only connecting to the cable. and also an old test standards. The cables have to be isolated, just the cable and you connect single-sided. So that means the test man is on one side which is then called the near end and the far end is just open, and there's nothing connected to that. That's the normal Slash ideal situation.

Steven Moore: Yep.

Robert Probst: So we would have

Robert Probst: To have a way that we're using typical high voltage EPR cable for our flexible, connections on cable, reels, and these have so called So multi-contact is a system by Stoibly a Swiss manufacturer of very well.

Steven Moore: I don't know. Stably.

Robert Probst: Yeah, very well and these MC connectors, they are the terminations on our cable. So they're compatible with all kinds of accessories that fit into them. Normally, we're using quite big crocodile, clamps or battery, clamps even elbow connectors, or something like that, to connect to the,…

Steven Moore: Cool.

Robert Probst: the power cable. In your case, you just said, It's really small cross-section twisted pair, I guess from the picture I got

Steven Moore: All that.

Robert Probst: yeah.

Steven Moore: That's for the network test in powering, any kind of equipment that would be, lower powered. these trailers are going to be probably a half million dollars apiece, two hundred thousand a half million dollars apiece and they're going to be something very large 40 feet long. So I think we have the space for whatever put on there. if we're talking about that kind of requirement 60,000 have

Robert Probst: No, no I'm not talking about space, I'm talking about what are we connecting to and how difficult that would be? Very practical question because of the connection is we are set up to connect to typical power industry. Things.

Steven Moore: Okay. Sorry I misundersteer question. No. the full server would be just powering the electronics whatever you are on, whatever it is that you need to power that are on the edge. if there's a say, for instance, I'm just picking random stuff on your website but just say This set of stuff right here. if this needed to be on the edge or somewhere in the room and remote location or something along those lines, it would be connected. To the core with.

### 00:25:00

Steven Moore: Fiber optic cable through, switching, your standard Ethernet or network stuff. And then if it needs connection that way, or as far as power is concerned, I don't know how this thing runs, battery and Battery AC mains, Line operated. Right? So that's saying okay so you could have an AC connection using Volt server to power this thing That's all I'm…

Robert Probst: Yeah.

Steven Moore: whatever you're connecting to out after that, if you have to connect to a, high voltage cable with alligator clips, or whatever you need. Totally fine to do. there's no barrier there.

Robert Probst: That's fine. Input power is not really my concern. I'm saying, when you do fault location on these lines, The equipment is connected at the start of the cable, you need to fault locate on. And the question is,…

Steven Moore: Yep.

Robert Probst: What do we connect to their exactly? And how would we do it? Because this is before we get into any discussion about what voltage jewels or whatever the connection here,…

Steven Moore: Yeah.

Robert Probst: I see let's say it's still unclear to me. What is the cable under test? That we want to locate What does it look like at the place…

Steven Moore: 

Robert Probst: You said, we part the trailer here and this is where the equipment is Well?

Steven Moore: Yeah.

Robert Probst: Okay then this is my connection point Where do I connect there? And how do I do that?

Steven Moore: Okay, so say for instance, we're, at this in particular station here, but somebody stole the cable Out of the ground say up here or something, right? so, this is where we're once the cable from Again, me not knowing your system.

Steven Moore: That means that when we're sitting here and we're looking at this station in particular, if there's a cable that comes out of the ground into the skate, a box, you could connect to that cable. what that cable is, I don't know because we're talking about a stuff in Texas is gonna be different. The stuff Mississippi to be the stuff up in Montana. All different setups. At least have a star's been working with them for, I mean, I don't know if they standardized very much on, electricity, but other network side is terrible. So, you're saying that you'd have to connect with your alligator clips to the power cable that is here. And then it would then see how far away it is that they dug up the cable in this, Line, that's correct.

Robert Probst: Yeah, so So, the honestly speaking, I don't want to connect to any kind of fiber, optic, or network cable, or whatever, because these are very different cables, that we normally fault locate on. I mean, those, you can almost call them telecom cables.

Steven Moore: Yeah. Yes,…

Robert Probst: And we,…

Steven Moore: we're not connecting right now.

Robert Probst: our equipment is for connecting to power cables like straight,…

Steven Moore: I'm gables. We're not testing those.

Steven Moore: Yes. Yes, right.

Robert Probst: okay, it has an output, it's three connections, you connect to a conductor, you connect to a shield when it is a shielded cable and…

Steven Moore: Yep.

Robert Probst: you need to connect to the system ground. Now I saw that you showed this twisted pair thing or whatever, So I just don't want to get confused here.

Steven Moore: Yeah. No.

Robert Probst: What is the power cable here? That we're fault locating on?

Steven Moore: It could be five. We'll say, 500 mcm, power cable. How about that? That'll be what's under the ground?

Robert Probst: okay, so okay so let's say 500 kcml or MCM, shielded EPR or…

Steven Moore: Yeah.

Robert Probst: XLPE cable

Steven Moore: Let's say it's shielded. now again,…

Robert Probst: Yeah, I mean yes. Yes.

Steven Moore: There's gonna be a lot of different cables of every size, shape, and variety. Across all of ExxonMobil. So we're not talking about one specific problem. We're talking about a problem that has again, occur across any oil field in the country, that could be Any kind of issue. The problem.

Robert Probst: Okay, but I have to say, I mean, but we have the same thing with utilities. You have low medium voltage cables but there's commonalities in the construction and in the type of the cable. So my view is a forty thousand foot view that if I can classify them into a low voltage construction, which is a typical unshielded, single multi-core or a triplex kind of whatever these things. Or in a medium voltage, construction class, which are single core or three core shielded cables with typical medium voltage, insulation XLPE or EPR. We're set up for this. I don't really think that there is any power cable out there. That would be a really big surprise, it's just a variety,…

### 00:30:00

Steven Moore: Great.

Robert Probst: but our connections are made to adhere to this.

Robert Probst: Variety kind of, but I want to make sure…

Steven Moore: Perfect.

Robert Probst: what I want to make sure we cannot connect to any kind of a thin wire or fiber optic or Ethernet or anything like that.

Steven Moore: No that wasn't what your testing That is a system we've developed. To The Testing Apparati as far as our testing stuff. So we have network testing, power cable goes all the way up. two kilometers text and Ethernet switch that we manufacture for the system, The Ethernet switch would go to the state of box to do the network testing. Right then…

Robert Probst: 

Steven Moore: where that poe connect to the volt server stuff. That could be any kind of test equipment that you could ever possibly want. anything that you need power to the not to test but power that the actual testing equipment. That was the only reason why I was bringing that was to tell you. Yeah.

Robert Probst: I see. Okay.

Robert Probst: Yeah, and in that case, the small equipments that we have in the portfolio, they have a battery option. And when we're talking cable test vans or something like that, there's typically what this very common in the utility and service provider world is either, the vehicle is equipped with an onboard power supply. Of, for instance, a second alternator or a underfloor synchronous generator on the front, axle, with power take off from the gearbox or…

Steven Moore: Yep.

Robert Probst: a lithium iron inverter battery pack or something like that or an external diesel generator that powers the test, then something like this. So personally I don't see the input power so much of an issue.

Steven Moore: Yep.

Robert Probst: It's really important that we understand what is the device under test that we're connecting to and that we can actually make this connection without having to in

Robert Probst: Something new because that would be a little bit of a hurdle because then somebody would have to sit down and specifically develop new accessories and that is time consuming.

Steven Moore: That is correct. And yeah, what your test fans with the,…

Robert Probst: Because

Steven Moore: your onboard power system, right over power supply, how far away? Is this thing that, will really an extension cord basically, with your test, equipment out to somewhere. Be someone's like, walking around outside of the van with your gear, connect to the vans, ups or how does that.

Robert Probst: No, see that the portable equipment that the receivers, they're all battery. Powered, let's say the digital phone which is the search wave receiver. Or so, those are all they can operate. Many hours, Let's say this stuff and the vans they have essentially, they are limited by the vehicle. For instance, how much gas you have in the tank is How long you can run the second alternator or whatever or whatever your battery capacitance or…

Steven Moore: Right.

Robert Probst: remaining capacity is so that belongs to the periphery of the system. So there's what we sell is essentially the measurement system and if a customer wants to have it installed in a trailer vehicle or whatever the periphery is kind of the furniture, the storage space and…

Steven Moore: Right.

Robert Probst: the onboard power supply, AC and connectivity package for making Internet.

Robert Probst: Action remote control and these things.

Steven Moore: So we're almost talking the The only thing that I am Curious about So I know these are battery. did you phone here? and then,…

Robert Probst: Yes.

Steven Moore: How does your set up work? So you say, You take your van in the same scenario. Where would you your van and…

Robert Probst: Yes.

Steven Moore: this setup. the fall. the people sold the cable from here? Where would you park your van is to try to find it? You didn't know where the guys stole the cable, Where would you go? and park said Van. To track this down. Would it be at? Where say, the

Robert Probst: CC, that now depends on the subdivision here, on how I would call The topology of the cable system is.

### 00:35:00

Steven Moore: Yep.

Robert Probst: So, is this now a radial from one point is a kind of a main connection point and it runs in a radio way to these different pumps or is this more of a branched network that has a trunk line with branches that branch to the different. So we need to be really.

Steven Moore: Yep.

Robert Probst: I would like to see maybe even a schematic or so it doesn't have to be a full on version, but let's say an abstract version of it showing kind of how the subdivision is spreading out.

Steven Moore: Yeah. that is the thing that will be changing depending on wherever you are. But what's this assume just for the sake of what we're talking about here is that it is a branch system and this is where, it comes out from and then it comes out that's branching out from here to go to different parts of the place.

Robert Probst: Okay.

Steven Moore: And we don't know this is broken. And then we are doing our testing.

Robert Probst: Yes.

Steven Moore: Would it be the best place to do? It would be after this branch, we're over here. Testing, you realize, there's no power. You could then

Steven Moore: start say we

Robert Probst: Yes. depending on the information you have it's always a good choice to go to a more strategic point. But if you know nothing, you can always connect to the main station that you showed there and just measure into the branch network or whatever. The topology is, what I'm getting here is that different topologies here and inhibit or…

Steven Moore: That.

Robert Probst: or favor certain methods. So we have in the United States in the metropolitan areas something that is called branch downtown networks.

Steven Moore: Right.

Robert Probst: And we have solutions for that but they work very different or not very differently. they use different methods than your d a to be straight runs or the open rings to open loops or whatever and it's just a different topology that requires a different set of methods.

Robert Probst: But the big all-in-one system is equipped with almost everything. So you always have a choice to, let's say, if you say, Hey in California, it doesn't make a difference for the test system as long as the,…

Steven Moore: Great.

Robert Probst: as long as the operator knows. how to fault locate in a situation like that. So if the power is often that branch.

Steven Moore: Great.

Robert Probst: You go to some point within that branched area and you start measuring into some of these branches to see what you can do.

Steven Moore: So the all-in-one system could we then integrate your all-in system into these giantastic apparati that we're building.

Robert Probst: It's difficult because we have a system. I would honestly compare it or not like Apple. We have a closed hardware platform and a closed software platform. And so it's difficult to integrate our stuff in others…

Steven Moore: 

Robert Probst: because it's own. Let's say platform everywhere. We have a control unit that is industrial grade. And on this proprietary control unit runs a proprietary set of software applications and…

Steven Moore: Yep.

Steven Moore: Yep.

Robert Probst: their software applications are equipped to communicate with the hardware and do all the necessary setup of the components to generate a certain high voltage output. So we're kind of

Robert Probst: our bubble if an external system would want to connect to us, this would be kind of a very difficult to do. I'm very honest about this.

Steven Moore: It's fine because honestly all your stuff could completely closed loop completely proprietary. It just would be in a separate slot in the server rack. you have his own HMI if you want doesn't matter that's totally fine. there's no.

Robert Probst: Okay. Yeah.

Steven Moore: Not try to integrate it into a bigger system. it can even have its own complete separate, segment of the, wireless network. You really want to do it. If you have the Hmis, you're wanting around with, the tablet to PCs, we could have a specific one for power. So one for, whatever. Not a problem even that doesn't bother me one bit, not even a little bit.

Robert Probst: Yeah, so that is actually possible that we have trailer solutions out there that. the process would be if it's really become serious. We need the dimensions typically of the vehicles of the customers, then we would start making drawings. And look how we would fit the system in there, with the typical electrical safety considerations that you need and the working area and whatnot. And Then we would just say Okay this is your trailer. You have assigned this space for our little cube there. the centric system it's kind of a Roughly by one meter approximately

Steven Moore: Is it? Yep.

Robert Probst: And we would need a science space for that. And then you need the connection stuff.

Steven Moore: Wrong.

Robert Probst: So the cable reels, and everything comes after you need some clearances for the,…

Steven Moore: Okay.

Robert Probst: for the high voltage and for the wiring and everything and then you would have somewhere an access point where somebody from the outside could access the high voltage reels and pull them off and connect them to the power cable. And on the other side, with the control unit is, you could have some sort of chair or bench or something, where you can sit in front of the system, and then the operator space operate. The unit, This is pretty much our core business and essentially, we just need to know what the clearances to the ceiling, and whatnot. So we can see Or if we have to say, Hey, we need more space and then, you can pretty much it. Also, the earth,

Robert Probst: Everything, the grounding has to be tied to the vehicle frame, as well to the chassis, because a single-point grounding safety hazardous, touch potentials. It's all very important to be taken care of. And then you can pretty much have your,…

Steven Moore: Yep.

Robert Probst: it's almost kind of a skid system, you…

Steven Moore: Great.

Robert Probst: it's not a full test anything, we would deliver the system, it can be installed and then it sits as a giant but just an additional component there next to your other stuff and you would be able to use it from there, yes.

Steven Moore: Perfect. That's exactly what I was hoping you say, because you're talking to the guy who is designing the trailer from the ground up. So You're coming in at just the right time. So just this is one that we're designing and working on over the last, Since March, we've been doing this. so,

Robert Probst: Yeah, and I would want to say you're focused on the centrix we have a more compact system even which is called the premieron It is made to fit in much smaller spaces as well.

Steven Moore: Great.

Robert Probst: Since you don't need any testing and diagnostics we can focus on just default location which makes the footprint, much much less even and now the question would be to find out which capabilities fit your use case, better is the Permian enough. Or does it really have to be a centrix? Because the centrix that is an advanced weapon system so to And if you have a fairly straightforward fault location test, I see your cable length. They are not really anything that, robs me from sleep here, like 2000 4,000 feet, that's nothing in our world. So,

Robert Probst: I'm just questioning here. if you really would want to go with over the top, big solution that can really kill everything, or if you rather go with a more focused smaller solution,

Steven Moore: It'll be probably more focused watchers. I just picked that just because I saw the van

Robert Probst: Yeah, but that is the top of the line product.

Steven Moore: Yeah, So the process from here on Would be out introduce you to the Mitsubishi, folks, and the ExxonMobil folks. And then we would design this thing to make sure that we're getting everything that we need.

Robert Probst: Yeah.

Steven Moore: And then again modular, we can put another thing in depending on what part of the country we're in. Because maybe the folks over in Texas have a whole different problem and the guys over Mississippi, which might need a centrix versus a Permian who knows just depends on where we're going. As you know, that kind of thing is a large project that

Steven Moore: It goes all the way into the production, If they designed the dotted line, It's going to be A very interesting, a adventure. Probably counting in the thousands of units on the upside.

Robert Probst: Yeah, they The thing is what I would want to do before you go too deep into designing this stuff. we have a chance to bring, even if it's just a powerful portable unit out there somewhere and just do a field trial like a demo or let's say proof of concept that, we can bring our fault location equipment and we can do fault location almost in a traditional sense from our point of view. I would really appreciate the opportunity to bring a unit in the field and…

### 00:45:00

Steven Moore: Or. Absolutely.

Robert Probst: do it. Yeah.

Steven Moore: Absolutely, I'd be crazy if I didn't do that.

Robert Probst: Yeah. Yeah.

Steven Moore: Yeah, and on top of that, there'll be, the proof of concept. We presentation, make sure, your solutions work, number two approve for concept. We could put it all in a trailer to do both the power and fall testing at the same, trailer as we're doing the network testing and backup all that stuff. has to be worked on but there's only I think eight units will be going to for the proof of concept. there's two giant ones, two medium size ones and two ones that are they're supposed to be going off-roading. So this is Mississippi but then,

Steven Moore: The hard one or the difficult one for this, we have the hardest thing freaking out to go in solution out is the ones for Montana because this piece of land is all mountains. So it's all just mountains and it's 83,000 acres or so spanning it's all still oil fields going pretty go start. These were the end of it is. Yeah, just the last one is here. So we're talking

Steven Moore: Because all the way down there, we're talking to you so far down.

Steven Moore: Still down there. Right around.

Steven Moore: Somewhere around here.

Steven Moore: 75 miles or so, something like that. It's a pretty big chunk of land. They actually go further down that definitely does.

Steven Moore: Yeah, so very long stretch of land and it's mountainous terrain, so you can't have too big of a trailer, so they ask me more compact for sure. So, that's one scenario. This would be the most challenging one and then the ones over in the Permian Basin. That's a wide open space. We can pack whatever we want and then we could take the centrix and Throwing everything you possibly want. Because you have giant trailer, we can tow around with that also Semi truck really wanted to

Steven Moore: Because not only reading testing, we're also doing temporary backup of both the communication systems and the power systems at the same time. all in one giant trailer.

Robert Probst: 

Steven Moore: So yeah, there you go. I think A good idea could just gives you a good idea. And if you're interested, let me know. And then I'm gonna start These introduction finished making the introductions of potentially. What do you guys doing tomorrow? At. 1 pm eastern.

Robert Probst: There's some training activity here, going on, in some other things. So I don't know if I am free tomorrow. Jason.

Steven Moore: All right.

Jason Aaron: And yeah,…

Steven Moore: 

Jason Aaron: tomorrow is the same for me.

Steven Moore: a guy from Exxon is meeting us from Mitsubishi and he's not gonna be free till mid-November. for his next meeting, this guy is the head of the field operations for Exxon's Low, Carbon Solutions Division for, that entire two million acres of land. So it's not a problem, we'll have work, time to discuss. I'll give, something like the fire, drill, you'll have the opportunity, like talk to Mitsubishi then be brought into Exxon, the NDA signed all that kind of stuff. But yeah, Elk is contingent on you interested in discussing more, I'm assuming

Robert Probst: Yes.

Steven Moore: Very cool. It's gonna be fun. Yeah. you're the last piece the puzzle. I've been trying to get a mat to get me over to you folks for a bit Mr. Pinard. Hopefully you speak highly of me. You talk to him next.

Steven Moore: Yeah, Awesome.

Robert Probst: If two further for the field tries by the way, we don't have to bring a full system or anything because we don't have a demo vend available right now. But there's a portable unit that is pretty powerful because it is kind of from the test then world, that's the stx 40\. That would also be the fault location part of the Permian.

### 00:50:00

Robert Probst: So I think it's right there, if you scroll,…

Steven Moore: Yeah.

Robert Probst: there it is. Yeah, that is at the top of the line. Portable fault, location unit, very rugged for outdoors IP 43 can be used in the rain and whatnot, and that would be for me, sufficient to have a proof of concept because if I can use this unit, I can use any event system in a similar fashion because the vans are just this stuff on steroids. So to speak, they have more and more jewels more maybe especially the centrix but the methodology built into this unit. It's pretty test than

Steven Moore: Perfect. All right, cool. So I have a meeting this starting now, I've ran out of time, so we will get the next steps going.

Robert Probst: Sure.

Steven Moore: Let's get nda's all around and all kind of stuff and I think we have a good time.

Robert Probst: Yeah, thank you.

Steven Moore: Absolutely, you gentlemen, have a wonderful evening and I appreciate your availability. Bye guys.

Jason Aaron: Thanks a lot Steven.

Robert Probst: No problem. Enjoy bye.

Jason Aaron: Bye.
