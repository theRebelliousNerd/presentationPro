  Outline:

  - {{{this}}}
  {{/each}}

  For each slide, generate:

  *   A concise title.
  *   An array of 1-4 bullet points summarizing the key information for the slide.
  *   Detailed speaker notes that not only explain the slide's content but also create a compelling narrative that flows smoothly from one slide to the next, telling a cohesive story throughout the presentation. The speaker notes should be crafted with the techniques of the great orators in mind.
  *   A descriptive image prompt that can be used to generate a relevant image for the slide.

  Return the result as a JSON array of slide objects. Each slide object should have the following structure:

  {
    "title": "Slide Title",
    "content": ["Bullet point 1", "Bullet point 2"],
    "speakerNotes": "Detailed notes for the presenter that connect this slide to the previous one and set up the next one.",
    "imagePrompt": "A descriptive image prompt"
  }

  Ensure that the output is valid JSON.
